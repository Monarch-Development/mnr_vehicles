## Monarch Vehicles

Experimental resource aimed at improving the Fivem General Vehicle System with the following goals:
- Build a clean core for vehicle management and their characteristics (a real one not only in name)
- Study the native system thoroughly and as far as it can be pushed
- Build a solid system that does not allow abuse of game physics (anti curb boost etc.)
- Check the limits in terms of validation to avoid exploit by cheat and build a system that blocks them (boost and various changes of speed and characteristics)
